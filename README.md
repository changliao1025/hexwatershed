## `HexWatershed`

HexWatershed: a mesh independent flow direction model for hydrologic models.

This is the C++ back-end of the HexWatershed Python package (https://github.com/changliao1025/pyhexwatershed). 

The HexWatershed Version v1.0 has been moved under the PNNL Github account at:
https://github.com/pnnl/hexwatershed

Currently, only HexWatershed v3.0 is maintained and supported.
